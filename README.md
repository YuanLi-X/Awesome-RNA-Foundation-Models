A curated, continuously updated catalog of **RNA sequence foundation models**, covering reusable RNA/mRNA/CDS/UTR sequence backbones and checkpoints, specialized RNA-family or structure-aware sequence models, adapted / derived RNA language models, and generative RNA sequence models.

> **Scope.** Included model entries must introduce or release a reusable sequence model, backbone, or checkpoint whose pre-training / large-scale training corpus explicitly includes RNA, mRNA, CDS, UTR, transcript, ncRNA, RNA metagenomic, or RNA/transcript-derived sequence data, and must support embedding extraction, fine-tuning, generation, or broad transfer to RNA downstream tasks. Downstream-only predictors/designers, reverse-translation or inverse-folding pipelines, RNA 3D prediction systems, DNA/protein/multi-omics FMs with no explicit RNA/transcript sequence pre-training signal, expression-profile/RNA-seq feature models, protein-only models, single-cell foundation models, and non-model resources are excluded from model entries; benchmarks and surveys are listed separately.

## Paper List

A survey list of RNA sequence foundation models and RNA-inclusive sequence foundation models included in this survey. Each entry shows the model/resource name separately from the official paper title. Four classification views are provided below — click to expand/collapse each view.

<!-- **Classification rules**:

- **Core RNA Foundation Models**: reusable RNA or mRNA sequence backbones pre-trained on raw nucleotide sequences for broad downstream transfer or generation.
- **Specialized RNA Foundation Models**: RNA-specific pre-trained models whose scope is limited to a subtype, species, structural modality, or narrow biological question.
- **Adapted / Derived RNA Models**: models that adapt, extend, or transfer existing pre-trained components but still yield a reusable RNA language model.
- **Broad RNA-Inclusive Foundation Models**: broader nucleotide, biological-sequence, central-dogma, or multi-modal foundation models whose pre-training explicitly includes RNA / transcript sequences and whose checkpoints support reusable sequence representations, fine-tuning, or generation for RNA-relevant tasks.
- **Excluded from this list**: downstream-only predictors/designers, reverse-translation or inverse-folding pipelines, RNA 3D prediction systems, DNA/protein/multi-omics FMs with no explicit RNA/transcript sequence pre-training signal, expression-profile/RNA-seq feature models, protein-only models, single-cell foundation models, non-model datasets/benchmarks/surveys as model entries, and papers with no reusable sequence model. -->

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find a missing RNA foundation model, benchmark, or survey paper, please:

1. Open an issue with the model/paper details
2. Or submit a pull request following the existing table format

**What to include**: reusable sequence foundation models with explicit RNA, mRNA, CDS, UTR, transcript, ncRNA, RNA metagenomic, or RNA/transcript-derived sequence pre-training / large-scale training signal that can support embedding extraction, fine-tuning, generation, or broad transfer to RNA downstream tasks.

**What NOT to include**: downstream-only predictors/designers, reverse-translation or inverse-folding pipelines, RNA 3D prediction systems, DNA/protein/multi-omics FMs with no explicit RNA/transcript sequence pre-training signal, expression-profile/RNA-seq feature models, single-cell foundation models, protein-only models, non-model datasets/benchmarks/surveys as model entries, or papers with no reusable sequence model.

**Metadata workflow**: confirmed entries live in `data/papers.yaml`, temporary discoveries go to `data/candidates.yaml`, and intentionally excluded items are tracked in `data/excluded.yaml`. A scheduled GitHub Action scans recent arXiv, bioRxiv, and Crossref metadata, auto-classifies promotable RNA-sequence or RNA-inclusive sequence foundation model candidates into draft `data/papers.yaml` records, regenerates `README.md` and `assets/model_timeline.svg`, and opens a review PR. After editing confirmed metadata, run `python generate_paper_list.py` and `python scripts/validate_papers.py`; CI also checks that generated README content is committed.
